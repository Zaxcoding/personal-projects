Ideas for the LevelEditor and Game.

LevelEditor:
//	Ability to type filenames to screen- not console. - delaying this for now, really had difficulty with it.
Add a settings/dev menu (accessible by ` key) to turn off/on different displays on the screen.
Initial menu with new, load, controls.
Change the start > to it's own number key (3?), take it away from right click.
Adjust to make easier to add new Shapes.
Add moving of already-placed Shapes. (right click to select, then left click to place)
	- Like sampling with eyedropper tool
	- Also, when you select it surrounds with a few pixel thick light colored boundary.
Saving only prompts for filename if you save as (with shift), or have no filename already.

Made disappearingBox actually work!
