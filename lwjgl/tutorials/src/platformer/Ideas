Ideas for the LevelEditor and Game.

LevelEditor:
// DONE - Ability to type filenames to screen- not console.
Add a settings/dev menu (accessible by ` key) to turn off/on different displays on the screen.
Initial menu with new, load, controls.
// DONE - Change the start > to it's own number key (3?), take it away from right click.
// DONE - Adjust to make easier to add new Shapes.
// DONE - Add moving of already-placed Shapes. (right click to select, then left click to place)
	// DONE - Like sampling with eyedropper tool
	// DONE - Also, when you select it surrounds with a few pixel thick light colored boundary.
Saving only prompts for filename if you save as (with shift), or have no filename already.

// DONE - Made disappearingBox actually work!
